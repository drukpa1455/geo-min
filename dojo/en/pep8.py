# Naming Conventions

# Overriding Principle
# No specific code example, just a reminder, names to be wise,
# Conveying meaning, truth they personify.

# Descriptive: Naming Styles
# No specific code example, meaningful names, profound and deep,
# Code's language, where understanding shall seep.

# Prescriptive: Naming Conventions

## Names to Avoid
# No specific code example, a cautionary decree,
# Obscure names, clarity we decree.

## ASCII Compatibility
# No specific code example, embracing ASCII's soul,
# Universal harmony, where coding's truth shall unroll.

## Package and Module Names
# No specific code example, lowercase with humble grace,
# Forging paths, a tranquil embrace.

## Class Names
class MyClass:
    pass

class AnotherClass:
    pass

## Exception Names
try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except ValueError as e:
    # Named exception, its essence portrayed,
    # Understanding chaos, with clarity conveyed.

try:
    # code that may raise another exception
except KeyError as e:
    # Another exception, named to ignite,
    # Its identity revealed, in code's sacred light.

## Global Variable Names
GLOBAL_CONSTANT = 42

GLOBAL_VARIABLE = "Hello, world!"

## Function and Variable Names
my_variable = 42

another_variable = "Hello!"

def my_function():
    pass

def another_function():
    pass

# Function and Method Arguments

# Default Argument Values
def my_function(arg1, arg2=None):
    """
    Default paths, flexibility unfurled,
    Embracing choices, a serene world,
    Versatility, where code's wisdom is hurled.
    """
    if arg2 is None:
        arg2 = []

def another_function(arg1, arg2=True, arg3=10):
    """
    A realm of possibilities, options abound,
    Default values, where power is found,
    Embracing adaptability, code's peace shall resound.

    Arguments in harmony, a gentle sway,
    Positional and keywords, in unity they play,
    Code's serenade, where insights lay.

# Function and Method Decorators
# No specific code example, a domain where decorators weave,
# Enchanting magic, where code's essence does conceive.

# Intermezzo: Coding Style
# No specific code example, a moment of reflection, a serene abode,
# Harmonizing style and substance, where peace is bestowed.

## Guidelines & Best Practices

### Use of the Backslash
my_string = (
    "Lines gracefully flow, in perfect accord, "
    "Backslash unites, their spirits soared, "
    "Poetry of code, where beauty is restored."
)

another_string = (
    "Lines entwined, a path divine, "
    "Backslash, a bridge, where thoughts align, "
    "A journey of code, where secrets intertwine."
)

### When to Use Trailing Commas
my_list = [
    "item1",
    "item2",
    "item3",  # Trailing comma, an elegant pause,
              # Readability heightened, without a cause,
              # Growth and flexibility, a harmonious applause.
]

another_list = [
    "item1",
    "item2",
    "item3",
]

### Accessing Protected Members
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._protected_variable = 42

    def _protected_method(self):
        pass

class AnotherClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._protected_variable = 10

    def _protected_method(self):
        pass

### Public and Internal Interfaces
class MyClass:
    def public_method(self):
        pass

    def _internal_method(self):
        pass

class AnotherClass:
    def public_method(self):
        pass

    def _internal_method(self):
        pass

# Conclusion
"""
Embrace PEP8's prophecy,
Code's artistry, creating harmony,
In simplicity, the code shall be free.
"""

# References
"""
Seek wisdom's ancient scrolls,
Sages' guidance, where knowledge unfolds,
Code's journey, where serenity beholds.

# Naming Conventions

# Overriding Principle
# No specific code example, a reminder to choose names with clarity, a vital essence.

# Descriptive: Naming Styles
# No specific code example, meaningful names, the heart's mile.

# Prescriptive: Naming Conventions

## Names to Avoid
# No specific code example, caution's plea,
# Obscurity's ban, clarity's decree.

## ASCII Compatibility
# No specific code example, embrace ASCII's grace,
# Universal harmony, code's vibrant embrace.

## Package and Module Names
# No specific code example, lowercase with underscore's bliss,
# Forging paths, code's eternal kiss.

## Class Names
class MyClass:
    pass

class AnotherClass:
    pass

## Exception Names
try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except ValueError as e:
    # Exception named, its power tamed,
    # With understanding, chaos tamed.

try:
    # code that may raise another exception
except KeyError as e:
    # Another exception subdued,
    # Named, its identity renewed.

## Global Variable Names
GLOBAL_CONSTANT = 42

GLOBAL_VARIABLE = "Hello, world!"

## Function and Variable Names
my_variable = 42

another_variable = "Hello!"

def my_function():
    pass

def another_function():
    pass

# Function and Method Arguments

# Default Argument Values
def my_function(arg1, arg2=None):
    """
    Default paths unfold,
    Flexibility, code's stronghold,
    Harmony, stories untold.
    """
    if arg2 is None:
        arg2 = []

def another_function(arg1, arg2=True, arg3=10):
    """
    A world of choices,
    Default values, diverse voices,
    Versatility rejoices.
    """
    pass

# Keyword Arguments and Positional Arguments
def my_function(arg1, arg2, *args, **kwargs):
    """
    Arguments in dance,
    Positional and keywords, code's romance,
    Harmony in every chance.
    """
    pass

def another_function(arg1, arg2, *args, **kwargs):
    """
    A symphony, united calls,
    Positional and keywords, as the light falls,
    Flowing river, code's grand halls.
    """
    pass

# Function and Method Decorators
# No specific code example, decorators' realm,
# Magic bestowed, code's sacred helm.

# Intermezzo: Coding Style
# No specific code example, a moment to pause,
# Reflect on code's grandiose applause.

## Guidelines & Best Practices

### Use of the Backslash
my_string = (
    "Lines gracefully flow, "
    "Backslash binds, code's enchanting glow, "
    "Verse-like beauty, a rhythm to bestow."
    )

another_string = (
    "Lines connected, like a pathway defined, "
    "Backslash, the bridge, forever entwined, "
    "A story unfolds, a tale for the mind."
    )

### When to Use Trailing Commas
my_list = [
    "item1",
    "item2",
    "item3",  # Trailing comma's gentle touch,
                # Readability's flourish, it means so much,
                # Growth, painless and such.
]

another_list = [
    "item1",
    "item2",
    "item3",
]

### Accessing Protected Members
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._protected_variable = 42

    def _protected_method(self):
        pass

class AnotherClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._protected_variable = 10

    def _protected_method(self):
        pass

### Public and Internal Interfaces
class MyClass:
    def public_method(self):
        pass

    def _internal_method(self):
        pass

class AnotherClass:
    def public_method(self):
        pass

    def _internal_method(self):
        pass

"""
Embrace PEP8's grace,

Beauty in each trace.
